---------------
CEdge is a singly linked list

Future

When flatening curves if we try to flatten at integer values
we can avoid the ComplexSpan code path.

Direct2D uses a triangle for line segments intead of a quad. This reduces the number of vertices
for a line segment from 6 down to 5

If we're drawing lines there's not really any advantage to using triangle strips,
because we have very limited edge sharing. We can draw a line with 3 vertices.

In fact, D2D doesn't use triangle strips and just uses a triangle list.
